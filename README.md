Overview of the project

Project:  NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)

Objective
To enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language by designing algorithms and models for text processing, language understanding, and contextual learning. This aims to create solutions for applications like machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and document summarization.

Key Activities 
•	Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect text data from diverse sources
•	Feature Extraction: Transform text data into numerical representations using techniques like Bag of Words
•	Language Modeling: Train language models for predictive tasks, autocomplete features, or conversational systems.
•	Task-Specific Applications:
	Implement models for tasks like:
	Sentiment analysis
	Machine translation
	Question answering systems
Technology Used
•	Programming Languages: Python
•	Libraries and Frameworks: Python: Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
•	Visualization Tools: Matplotlib
•	Evaluation Tools: Tools for metrics computation
